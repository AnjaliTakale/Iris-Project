# Iris-Project

Project Overview:
The Iris Project focuses on the famous Iris Flower Dataset, which is often used for classification tasks in machine learning. This project aims to build a model that can classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their features such as petal and sepal length and width. The dataset is used to demonstrate basic machine learning concepts like data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset:
The Iris dataset includes the following columns:
Sepal Length: Length of the sepal in cm.                  
Sepal Width: Width of the sepal in cm.                  
Petal Length: Length of the petal in cm.                   
Petal Width: Width of the petal in cm.                         
Species: The target variable, indicating the species of the Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).                             
This dataset is widely used for classification tasks in machine learning due to its simplicity and well-defined structure.

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Handling Missing Data: The dataset is typically clean, with no missing values. However, in some cases, preprocessing may involve handling missing or outlier values.                 
Feature Scaling: Since features are on different scales (e.g., petal length vs. sepal width), the data may be normalized or standardized.                  
Label Encoding: The target variable ('Species') is converted to a numeric format for model training.     

Key Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language for data analysis and modeling.              
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.                  
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries used for creating various visualizations.                 
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and KNN (k-nearest neighbors).           

Conclusion:
The Iris Project provides a simple yet effective demonstration of classification tasks using the Iris dataset. The project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation. By applying machine learning models like KNN or decision trees, the project showcases how we can classify flower species based on their features. This serves as an excellent starting point for beginners in machine learning and data science.
